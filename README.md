# How to use
Grab data from gexbot using the `!triggers qqq` command, paste it into the [https://github.com/puab/greekinator/tree/main](https://puab.github.io/greekinator/) input to get an input string. Grab the input string and put it inside of the text box in the indicator's settings. Have fun :)

# Known issues
Only supports QQQ/NQ for now. Soon SPY/ES support
